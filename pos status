Based on the provided documentation and codebase, I'll explain how you can build a comprehensive customer profile system in Medusa and extend it for personalized shopping experiences.

### Current Customer Profile Structure in Medusa

The base CustomerDTO includes these key attributes:

```typescript
{
  id: string
  email: string
  first_name: string
  last_name: string
  company_name: string
  phone: string
  has_account: boolean
  addresses: CustomerAddress[]
  metadata: Record<string, unknown> // Custom key-value pairs
  groups: CustomerGroup[]
  created_at: Date
  updated_at: Date
}
```

### Extending Customer Profile for Personalization

You can extend the customer profile using the `metadata` field to store additional personalization data:

```typescript
// Example of extended customer metadata for personalization
const customerMetadata = {
  preferences: {
    favorite_categories: string[],
    size_preferences: {
      clothing: string,
      shoes: string
    },
    color_preferences: string[],
    brand_preferences: string[]
  },
  shopping_behavior: {
    last_viewed_products: string[],
    purchase_history_categories: string[],
    average_order_value: number,
    preferred_payment_methods: string[]
  },
  ai_insights: {
    recommended_categories: string[],
    style_profile: string[],
    next_purchase_prediction: string[]
  }
}
```

### Implementation Steps

1. **Create Custom Customer Service**:
```typescript
class CustomCustomerService {
  async updateCustomerPreferences(
    customerId: string, 
    preferences: any
  ) {
    const customerModuleService = container.resolve(Modules.CUSTOMER)
    
    return await customerModuleService.update(customerId, {
      metadata: {
        preferences: preferences
      }
    })
  }
}
```

2. **Track Customer Behavior**:
```typescript
const trackCustomerBehavior = createWorkflow(
  "track-customer-behavior",
  async (customerId, action) => {
    const customerModuleService = container.resolve(Modules.CUSTOMER)
    const customer = await customerModuleService.retrieve(customerId)
    
    const currentMetadata = customer.metadata || {}
    const behavior = currentMetadata.shopping_behavior || {}
    
    // Update behavior tracking
    behavior.last_viewed_products = [
      ...behavior.last_viewed_products || [],
      action.productId
    ].slice(-10) // Keep last 10 products
    
    await customerModuleService.update(customerId, {
      metadata: {
        ...currentMetadata,
        shopping_behavior: behavior
      }
    })
  }
)
```

3. **Create AI Recommendations Integration**:
```typescript
const updateAIRecommendations = createWorkflow(
  "update-ai-recommendations",
  async (customerId) => {
    const customerModuleService = container.resolve(Modules.CUSTOMER)
    const customer = await customerModuleService.retrieve(customerId)
    
    // Generate recommendations based on customer data
    const recommendations = await generateAIRecommendations({
      preferences: customer.metadata?.preferences,
      behavior: customer.metadata?.shopping_behavior
    })
    
    // Update customer profile with AI insights
    await customerModuleService.update(customerId, {
      metadata: {
        ...customer.metadata,
        ai_insights: recommendations
      }
    })
  }
)
```

4. **Access Profile in Storefront**:
```typescript
"use client"

import { useCustomer } from "../providers/customer"

export function PersonalizedRecommendations() {
  const { customer } = useCustomer()
  
  const preferences = customer?.metadata?.preferences || {}
  const aiInsights = customer?.metadata?.ai_insights || {}
  
  return (
    <div>
      <h2>Recommended for You</h2>
      {/* Display personalized recommendations */}
      {aiInsights.recommended_categories?.map(category => (
        <CategoryCard key={category} category={category} />
      ))}
    </div>
  )
}
```

### Key Features to Implement

1. **Preference Collection**:
- Create forms to collect explicit preferences
- Track implicit preferences through behavior
- Store preferences in customer metadata

2. **Behavior Tracking**:
- Product views
- Purchase history
- Category affinities
- Time spent on products/categories

3. **AI Integration**:
- Use collected data to generate recommendations
- Update recommendations periodically
- Store AI insights in customer metadata

4. **Personalization Features**:
- Personalized product recommendations
- Custom category sorting
- Tailored promotions
- Personalized email marketing

This approach leverages Medusa's existing customer module while extending it with rich personalization data through the metadata field. The system remains flexible and can be enhanced with additional personalization features as needed.

Remember to implement proper data privacy measures and comply with relevant regulations when collecting and storing customer data for personalization purposes.



Based on the provided codebase, I'll analyze how sales staff management is implemented in this POS system:

### Current Implementation

1. **Authentication System**
- The system currently has a basic authentication system implemented in `Login.tsx`
- It uses a single admin authentication flow through Medusa's admin API
- Login is handled via email and password credentials
- Session management is done using cookies for token storage

2. **Missing Sales Staff Features**
Despite claims in the README about sales rep analytics, the current implementation lacks:
- Multiple sales staff user accounts
- Sales rep-specific logins
- Individual sales tracking
- Performance metrics for sales representatives
- Staff role management

3. **Main Interface Access**
From `Main.tsx`, we can see that:
- There's a single login session
- No user role differentiation
- All logged-in users have access to the same features:
  - Continue Order
  - Connect Terminal
  - Register New Customer
  - Select Customer
  - Browse Catalog
  - Draft Orders

### Limitations

1. **Single Login System**
- Currently operates with a single admin login
- No multi-user support implemented
- No role-based access control (RBAC)
- Cannot track individual sales person activities

2. **Missing Sales Staff Features**
- No staff management interface
- No way to create/manage sales staff accounts
- Missing sales performance tracking
- No commission or goal tracking system
- No individual sales reports

### Recommendations for Production Implementation

To make this system production-ready for multiple sales staff, the following features should be implemented:

1. **User Management**
```typescript
interface SalesStaff {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  role: "admin" | "manager" | "sales";
  permissions: string[];
  active: boolean;
}
```

2. **Authentication Enhancement**
- Implement role-based authentication
- Add staff-specific login credentials
- Create session management for multiple users

3. **Sales Tracking**
```typescript
interface SalesTransaction {
  id: string;
  staffId: string;
  amount: number;
  timestamp: Date;
  commission: number;
}
```

4. **Performance Metrics**
- Individual sales tracking
- Commission calculation
- Goal tracking
- Performance analytics

5. **Access Control**
```typescript
const staffPermissions = {
  admin: ["all"],
  manager: ["view_reports", "manage_staff", "process_sales"],
  sales: ["process_sales", "view_own_performance"]
};
```

### Implementation Timeline

1. **Phase 1: Basic Staff Management (2-3 weeks)**
- Multi-user authentication
- Basic role management
- Staff profile creation

2. **Phase 2: Sales Tracking (2-3 weeks)**
- Individual sales attribution
- Basic reporting
- Commission tracking

3. **Phase 3: Analytics & Reporting (2-3 weeks)**
- Performance dashboards
- Goal tracking
- Advanced analytics

### Conclusion

The current system is **not production-ready** for multi-staff operations. It operates as a single-user POS system with basic authentication. To make it suitable for multiple sales staff:

1. **Required Changes**
- Implement multi-user authentication
- Add role-based access control
- Create staff management interface
- Develop sales tracking and analytics
- Add performance monitoring

2. **Development Priority**
- High Priority: Multi-user authentication and basic staff management
- Medium Priority: Sales tracking and attribution
- Lower Priority: Advanced analytics and reporting

3. **Estimated Timeline**
- 6-9 weeks for complete implementation
- 2-3 weeks for initial multi-user support
- Additional time for testing and refinement

The system needs significant development to support multiple sales staff effectively. The current implementation is more suited for a single-user or small business scenario rather than a multi-staff retail environment.
