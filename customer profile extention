Based on the provided documentation and codebase, Medusa.js does not provide built-in product rating and reviews functionality out of the box. This is not part of the core product module or any other standard modules.

From reviewing the Product Module documentation (`/packages/modules/product/README.md`), we can see that the product module primarily focuses on:
- Products
- Variants 
- Categories
- Basic product information management

To implement product ratings and reviews, you would need to:

1. Create a custom module or extend the existing product module
2. Create new database tables/models for:
   - Reviews
   - Ratings
   - Review metadata (like user info, timestamps etc)

Here's a high-level approach to implement this:

1. Create a custom reviews module:
```typescript
// Example structure for a custom reviews module
interface ProductReview {
  id: string
  product_id: string
  user_id: string
  rating: number // e.g. 1-5
  comment: string
  created_at: Date
  updated_at: Date
}

class ReviewService {
  async create(data: CreateReviewInput) {
    // Implementation
  }

  async list(productId: string) {
    // Implementation
  }

  async getAverageRating(productId: string) {
    // Implementation
  }
}
```

2. Link it with the Product module:
```typescript
// Extend product retrieval to include reviews
const product = await productService.retrieve(productId, {
  relations: ['reviews'] // You'll need to set up this relation
})
```

3. Create necessary API endpoints:
```typescript
// Example API route
router.post('/store/products/:id/reviews', (req, res) => {
  // Handle review creation
})

router.get('/store/products/:id/reviews', (req, res) => {
  // Handle fetching reviews
})
```

Since this functionality isn't built-in, you have the flexibility to implement it according to your specific needs. You could also consider:

1. Using a third-party review service and integrating it
2. Building a separate microservice for reviews
3. Creating a plugin for Medusa that handles reviews

The product module's current beta state focuses primarily on retrieving products, as mentioned in the documentation:

> The Product Module is currently in beta. The beta version comes with limited functionality, primarily centered around retrieving products.

For a complete review system, you'd need to handle:
- User authentication for reviewers
- Review moderation
- Rating calculations
- Review filtering and sorting
- Review metadata (verified purchases, helpful votes, etc)
